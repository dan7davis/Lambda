<h2>Boosting Your Memory</h2>
<p>You will encounter a great deal of new, exciting information throughout this course. In order to ensure that this information transforms into knowledge in your own memory, it is important that you practice effective learning strategies.</p>
<p>We would like to highlight one strategy in particular that has been found to be effective in boosting people's learning and memory: <strong>Memory Retrieval</strong>.</p>
<p>Memory Retrieval is simple: the more you access a memory, the stronger it becomes and the more likely you are to remember it in the long term.</p>

<div class="cont-intro">
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>In the days and weeks after you have completed a quiz assessment, go back and try answering the questions again! By revisiting the questions and re-retrieving the knowledge, this acts as a fantastic exercise for your brain--making the memories and knowledge stronger and longer-lasting. The longer a memory goes without being re-activated, the more likely it to be forgotten!</p>

<div class="treat-intro">
    <h2>Memory Retrieval Cues</h2>
    <p>
        In order to help you stay sharp and keep all of this new knowledge active in your memory, you will occasionally receive <strong>Memory Retrieval Cues</strong> throughout the course. These windows will appear over the existing page content and ask you a question from a previous course week.</p>
        <p>
            Your responses to these Retrieval Cues <b>*DO NOT COUNT*</b> towards your final grade in the course.
        </p>
    <div style="text-indent: 60px">
        <p>
        If you answer <font color="#009b00"><b>correctly</b></font>, the question will disappear, and you can move on! </p>
        <p>
        If you answer <font color="#C84B4B"><b>incorrectly</b></font>, you will be given another chance to answer! </p>
        <p>
        You can also opt to ignore the question by exiting the window with the button at the top right. </p>
