# Large-Scale Learning Analytics: Modeling Learner Behavior & Improving Learning Outcomes in Massive Open Online Courses


## [SRLx](https://github.com/dan7davis/Lambda/wiki)

This software allows learners in any edX course to plan their goals/intentions for each course week and monitor their progress towards them in real time. In creating this, I also offer an API to enable any real-time data collection and feedback in edX.

In Proceedings of the 13th European Conference on Technology-Enhanced Learning, EC-TEL '18.


## [Adaptive Retrieval Practice](https://github.com/dan7davis/Lambda/tree/master/retrieval%20practice)

This software encourages retrieval practice (or the testing effect) by sporadically presenting edX learners with a quiz question from a previous section/chapter in the course. We also used the data collected from it to track the extent to which MOOC learners retain knowledge over the long term. Published as: Davis, D., Kizilcec, R.F., Hauff, C., Houben, G.J. (2018) The Half-Life of MOOC Knowledge: A Randomized Trial Evaluating the Testing Effect in MOOCs. In Proceedings of 8th International Conference on Learning Analytics and Knowledge, LAK ’18.


## [Learning Tracker](https://github.com/ioanajivet/LearningTracker)

This weekly feedback mechanism for edX learners shows a spider chart comparing their behavior to previously successful learners.

In Proceedings of 7th International Conference on Learning Analytics and Knowledge, LAK ’17.

## [VidQuiz](https://github.com/dan7davis/In-Video-Quizzing)

This software exists because I wanted to do an experiment using in-video quizzes and found a total scarcity of open-source in-video quizing software. This software enables the creation of in-video quizzes (as well as normal quizzes and normal videos) with full activity logging capabilities. This has also been built in a way that makes it ready to be used in crowdsourcing contexts by using a token assignment/validation system. Published as: Davis, D., Hauff, C., Houben, G.J. (2018) Evaluating Crowdworkers as a Proxy for Online Learners in Video-Based Learning Contexts.
